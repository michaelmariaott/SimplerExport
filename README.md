# SimplerExport
Max4Live device to export sample slices from a Simpler device.

## Installation
Drag and drop the file into the File Browser of Ableton.

## Usage
On the same track with a Simpler device. It will automatically contect to the simpler device and try to load the sample and slicepoints. If it can't load the sample automatically, drag the same sample onto the "Drop Something Here!" zone.

Hover over the buttons or open the Info View of Ableton to see what each setting does.
